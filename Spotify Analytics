This project utilizes Kaggle data. I downloaded "Spotify top 50 songs in 2021".  
Next, I created a table for the data, and imported the data into the table. 
Lastly, I performed analytics on the data using SQLite Studio. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)


SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

-- 1. What are the top 5 artist based on popularity?

SELECT 
artist_name,
popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5;

-- 2. What is the average track duration?

SELECT 
AVG(duration_n)
FROM Spotifydata


-- 3. Top 2 artists who have the most songs in the top 50 list.

SELECT 
artist_name,
COUNT(track_name) no_of_tracks_in_top_50
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY no_of_tracks_in_top_50 desc
LIMIT 2;



-- 4. List all the artist that have more than 2 tracks.

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) AS tracks
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING tracks >1
ORDER BY tracks desc


-- 5. Which track is the shortest?

SELECT 
track_name, duration_ms as duration
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration asc
LIMIT 1;


-- 6. What is the most danceable track?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 1;

-- 7. List all the instrumental tracks

SELECT
track_name,
instrumentalness AS instrumental
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE instrumentalness <> 0
ORDER BY instrumental desc
